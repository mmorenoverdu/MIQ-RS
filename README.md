# Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised Second edition (MIQ-RS)

The Movement Imagery Questionnaire (MIQ) was originally developed in English ([Hall, Pongrac & Buckholz, 1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0167945785900065?via%3Dihub)). It was later modified as the MIQ-R ([Hall & Martin, 1997](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ft07979-000)). The MIQ-R was then revised as the MIQ-3 to distinguish between internal and external visual imagery ([Williams et al. 2012](https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/jsep/34/5/article-p621.xml)). The MIQ-3 is the latest version available for adults with no physical disabilities.

Specifically for adults with disabilities, the MIQ-R was modified is a second revision (MIQ-RS) by [Gregg et al. 2007](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/ecam/nem170) to include movements that were simpler to perform and imagine.

MIQ-RS: It is a 14-item questionnaire with 7 movements imagined in 2 sensory modalities (visual imagery and kinesthetic imagery).
  1.  Leg flexion (standing on one leg)
  2.  Arm raise with fist
  3.  Arm horizontal movement
  4.  Trunk flexion (hands to feet)
  5.  Pushing a swinging door
  6.  Glass lift
  7.  Opening and closing a door (with handle)

To include in your PsychoPy experiment, you just need to add a Pavlovia Survey routine and select the file, which should be in the directory where your PsychoPy experiment is.

In this questionnaire, we have color-coded the instructions according to the sensory modality that must be used during imagery. This helps participants switch between modalities and avoid confusion.

This questionnaire also has an attention check question half-way through (item 8.1).

After the questionnaire, the individual must respond if they physically executed the movement as instructed, and if so, how many times. They are also asked whetehre they had problems with performeing the movement(s).

At the end there are a couple of questions about the imagery experience/preferences:
  1. Their preference for using a particular imagery modality (visual and kinesthetic).
  2. Their preference for using a particular visual imagery perpsective (first-person and third-person).
  3. If they unintentionally used visual/kinesthetic imagery when asked to use the kinesthetic/visual.
